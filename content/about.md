> Software engineer. Machine learning researcher. Life long learner. Longboarder. Lover of coffee and tea. Tinkerer.

I started programming at the age of 7, using Visual Basic, after one of my dad’s colleagues had left some textbooks at our house. 
In my early teens I started doing freelancing work, mainly in web development, until I landed a part-time position at a game development studio (BrightMind Studios) based in Cape Town. 
I led a team of 3 as we worked on a series of brain-training puzzle games. 
After a few more years of freelancing I joined a South African media agency (MadePod) as a director and head of development. Our portfolio included Carte Blanche, Sage, Jacaranda FM and Netcare.

I eventually left to further my studies and focus on my own company.
I am currently a software engineer at [Entelect](https://www.entelect.co.za/) and am finishing my honours degree in computer science.
I am a firm believer in being a life-long learner and am continually striving to improve myself. 
I value the opinion of others and think it can be observed in my daily actions that I aim to make the world a better place.
I also like to think I have a good sense of humour.
My professional strengths include various programming languages (though a new one is easily learnt), leadership skills, project management, strong problem-solving skills and a lot of passion for what I do.
