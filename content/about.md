My most defining characteristic is probably my perfectionism. Although this has proven to be both a strength and a weakness, I have learnt to leverage it into being the former.

I started programming at the age of 7, using Visual Basic, after one of my dad’s colleagues had left some textbooks at our house. In my early teens I started doing freelancing work, mainly in web development, until I landed a part-time position at a game development studio (BrightMind Studios) based in Cape Town. I led a team of 3 as we worked on a series of brain-training puzzle games. My next position was quite a leap from the last. I was employed as lead designer for a 3D shooter game by a studio (Bonozo) based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where I was in charge of making critical decisions and leading a team (40 – 50 people) of artists, developers, musicians and testers. After a few more years of freelancing I joined a South African media agency (MadePod) as head of development and equal shareholder. Our portfolio included Carte Blanche, Sage, Jacaranda FM and Netcare.

I eventually left to further my studies and focus on my own company. I am currently finishing a degree in computer science and working as a research assistant at both the System Specifications and Formal Methods (SSFM) research group and the Computational Intelligence Research Group (CIRG). I am a firm believer in being a life-long learner and am continually striving to improve myself. I value the opinion of others and think it can be observed in my daily actions that I aim to make the world a better place. I also like to think I have a good sense of humour. My skillset includes various programming languages (Though a new one is easily learnt), leadership, project management, technical expertise and practical engineering skills.
