Yes, I skipped yesterday, but I don't feel bad.
I needed some down time after a hectic week and feel more motivated than before.
I even managed to make some time to practice playing guitar since I haven't been able to since I broke my arm a few weeks ago.

In tribute of my favourite childhood cartoon, here is today's drawing:
!["A drawing of Tom and Jerry for day 6 of Inktober 2019"](/images/inktober/day6.jpg "A drawing of Tom and Jerry for day 6 of Inktober 2019")

I drew it completely freehand but with direct observation of the reference image on this blog post about how [Tom and Jerry are reflections of our lives](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Heres-How-The-Life-Of-Tom-And-Jerry-Is-Basically-A-Reflection-Of-All-Of-Our-Lives/).

I think I might keep this trend of drawing cartoon characters going for a few days. They are not too difficult and it is very fun.

Till tomorrow!
