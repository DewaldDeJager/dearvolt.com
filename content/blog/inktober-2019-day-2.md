I wasn't too sure what to draw today, but I enjoyed the Zentangles quite a bit and knew I needed to get more control with the brush pen.
Yesterday I mentioned I still want to draw a mandala so I thought why not draw one today.
Mandalas are drawings that tend to be very geometric and have a spiritual meaning to them.
They typically represent maps of deities or the greater cosmos, showing the interconnectedness of everything.

This is what I came up with:
![Mandala I drew for day 2 of Inktober 2019](/images/inktober/day2.jpg "Mandala I drew for day 2 of Inktober 2019")

Probably the biggest lesson I learnt was that a brush pen is not the best tool for the job.
While drawing I realised that a few fine-liners of different thicknesses would probably be best.
Nonetheless, this additional challenge left a lot of room for growth and I was forced to using the tip of the brush pen for the finer details.
My fine control improved a lot.

Let's see what tomorrow holds.
