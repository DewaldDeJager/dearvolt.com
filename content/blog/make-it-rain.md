I only recently heard about a new fixed and mobile data network in South Africa called [Rain](https://rain.co.za).
I'm currently facing issues with a fibre line installation and thought I would give Rain a try until the fibre is installed.

I placed my order yesterday, 16 January 2019, at 10:30. It cost R50 for the SIM and 7 days uncapped data, and R1 for delivery by RAM couriers.
This morning at 10:48 I got a call from RAM: They were in the mail room! 42 minutes after the delivery I was FICA verified. 
Rain had managed to process my order completely in just over 24 hours!

After downloading 10.9GB in an hour, I decided to run some speed tests. The LTE router used was a Huawei B315. The results:

| Result ID                                                | Ping (ms) | Download (Mbps) | Upload (Mbps) |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| [7965385485](http://www.speedtest.net/result/7965385485) | 16        | 25.84           | 17.65         |
| [7965391008](http://www.speedtest.net/result/7965391008) | 15        | 31.88           | 18.22         |
| [7965395209](http://www.speedtest.net/result/7965395209) | 16        | 28.54           | 17.1          |
| [7965397984](http://www.speedtest.net/result/7965397984) | 18        | 28.66           | 16.07         |
| [7965400691](http://www.speedtest.net/result/7965400691) | 37        | 28.02           | 15.66         |
| **Average**                                              | 20.4      | 28.588          | 16.94         |

These speeds are above the average speed for mobile networks in South Africa and well above the average for fixed broadband speeds according to the [Speedtest Global Index](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index).
Depending on how the next 7 days go, I might keep the Rain SIM in my phone permanently even after the fibre is installed as I am extremely impressed with what I have seen thus far!
