Shading yesterday was pretty fun, so I decided to spice things up and find some more interesting forms to draw.
I found this [blog post](https://www.architectural-review.com/essays/editorial-form-does-not-follow/10018337.article) targeted at architects but it has some really interesting forms.

I decided to draw some of these completely freehand.
I drew a front view and then tried drawing it as it was on that image (1-point perspective if I'm not mistaken).
This is the result:

!["3D forms drawn from different views for day 4 of Inktober 2019"](/images/inktober/day4.jpg "3D forms drawn from different views for day 4 of Inktober 2019")

My freehand drawing has a long way to go, but it's only day 4 so I'm happy with what I got.
I also spent way less time than I have on the other drawings as I need to balance things a bit better.

I'm excited for tomorrow's drawing.
